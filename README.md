#Test task comments
1. The jsx transform can be implemented using express middleware - on-fly generating, but this is not industry standart, it's closer to the rail's pipeline. take a look at the lib/jsx-middleware.js
2. the main task can be implemented at the client-side, so in fact we do not need express here at all - just React. I'd like to display KISS'ing instead of express knowledge
