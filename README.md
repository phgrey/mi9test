#Test task comments
- The main task can be implemented at the client-side, so in fact we do not need express here at all - just React. I'd like to display KISS'ing instead of express knowledge. U can examine it by the next point e.g. :)))  

- The jsx transform can be implemented using express middleware - on-fly generating, but this is not industry standart, it's closer to the rail's pipeline w/o precompile. take a look at the lib/jsx-middleware.js

- Column-oriented form elements will look a bit prettier
 
- Three-files comparision is leading to classification tasks, some distance calculating and so on up to machine learning.

- The algorithms in external diff lib are suitable and production-ready. I need a reason to write something worse. And it takes too long for the test task to implement them by my own.
